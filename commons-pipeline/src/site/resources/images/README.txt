The .xcf files are GIMP native files.
The .sxd files are OpenOffice drawing files.

To create the PNG images:
1. Export drawing from OpenOffice to a PNG format file
2. Use an image editor to crop excess whitespace off the image.
3. Use an image editor to scale down output to 800 pixels in width,
   keeping height to width aspect ratio.
4. Save PNG image.
